# Background
Effort in the recreational abalone fishery is managed by daily limits, and until the 2019/2020 recreational fishing season the daily bag limit was set at a maximum of 10 abalone/licence/day, with a possession limit of 20 at any point in time. From 2010 to 2019 persistent declines in the commercial abalone fishery catch and catch rate were observed despite multiple decreases in the commercial TACC. Commercial CPUE is used as the sole proxy for biomass of the abalone resource, on the basis that the recreational catch is both small and difficult to accurately quantify. In 2019, a recommendation for closure of five key areas of the Tasmanian East Coast commercial blacklip abalone fishery was accepted. Similarly a reduction (but not closure) of the recreational bag limit to five abalone/licence/day was recommended and accepted to assist with recovery, and minimizing further risk of depletion of the abalone in key recreational fishing regions along the East Coast. 

In November 2021, the Tasmnaian Legislative Council rescinded the five-bag limit regulation, with an immediate return to the 2018/2019 recreational abalone fishery regulations and limits. As part of the motivation for the reversal of the bag limit reduction, it was argued that size limits were the most important management lever available, and that no efforts had been made to consider and/or implement increases in the size limit governing the recreational abalone fishery.

Here we explore the consequences of increases in the recreational abalone size limit on Tasmania's East Coast on the magnitude of the recreational abalone fishery harvest.


# Estimate Recreational harvest for by mean weight
Recreational abalone harvest has been routinely estimated by a phone-diary survey involving a random sample of license-holders since 1996. Participants record details of their fishing activity including date, location, method used, target species, start and finish times, and the number of abalone kept (harvested) for the survey period 1st November to 30th April the following year and thus only provide a partial season estimate. Data from respondents are then expanded to estimate the catch (number of abalone harvested) and effort of the entire recreational licensed population using a 'bootstraping' method to estimate 95% confidence limits using the percentile method. Estimated harvest weight (kg) is then estimated by multiplying the harvest number by the average weight of an individual abalone for each area based on commercial catch sampling data collected prior to 2018 (area 1 = 522 g, area 2 = 517 g, area 3 = 520 g) (Lyle et al. 2021).   

The estimated combined east coast (areas 1-3) blacklip abalone recreational harvest number for 2020-21 was n = 22882 (95% CI 12774-34777) (area 1 = 11756, area 2 = 9919, area 3 = 1207) (Lyle et al. 2021).  In 2020-21 this equates to 11916 kg (11.9 t) (see Table 6 in Lyle et al. 2021).

The estimated combined east coast (areas 1-3) blacklip abalone recreational harvest number for 2018-19 was n = 25671 (95% CI 13728-37139) (area 1 = 20339, area 2 = 2365, area 3 = 2967) (Lyle et al. 2019).  In 2018-19 this equates to 13167 kg (13.2 t) (see Table 6 in Lyle et al. 2019).

The following code have been developed to utilise the most recent data collected from the commercial abalone catch sampling program between 2019-2022.
